# Ludonarrative Dissonance: Is Storytelling About Reaching Harmony?
- Ludonarrative dissonance occurs when a  video game's gameplay and story conflict, creating a jarring experience for the player.
- Classic examples include the Uncharted seties, where protagonist Nathan Drake, a charming rougue, kill shundreds of people with little remark; and Far Cry 3, where an average person suddenly becomes a master of combat.
- This clash between gameplay (the "ludo" part) and narrative (the "narrative" part) can pull a player out of the experience and break their immersion. While many games exhibit some level of ludonarrative dissonance, games that successfully align these elements create a more cohesive and believable world. 
## Strategies to address this
### Emergent Narratives
- Many scholars propose using emergent narratives—sandbox-style systems where story arises naturally rather than being forced—to achieve harmony.
- There are five essential traits of emergent narratives: coherence (consistency & persistence), agency, possibility space, uncertainty, and co-authoring—where players help drive the story.
### Blended Narrative & Mechanics
- Scripted narrative moments and gameplay tightly. For instance, The Last of Us disrupts familiar mechanics (Ellie not responding to a familiar prompt), creating momentary dissonance that deepens emotional impact.
### Purposeful use of Dissonance
- Intentional dissonance can be a powerful storytelling tool. Forcing players to confront contradictions can provoke reflection.
