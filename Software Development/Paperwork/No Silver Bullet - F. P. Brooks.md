# No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering
Brooks argues that - *There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.*
The key learning this research provides is that -
- It's not the high level language, code assistant, environment or tools that improve your efficiency in the long run.
- It's the practices such as Requirements refinement and rapid prototyping, Incremental development (growing and not building the software) great product design.
